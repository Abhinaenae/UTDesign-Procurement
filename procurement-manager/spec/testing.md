# Welcome to Testing!

## The testing environment used (for now) is Jasmine which is mainly used for unit tests.

In the `spec/api` folder, each file corresponds to a folder in `pages/api` where each function in the file is a test case for the api.

In the `spec/lib` folder, each file correspond to a file in `lib`, which where scripts and functions that are reusable reside.
